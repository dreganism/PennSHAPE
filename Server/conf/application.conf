# Router
# ~~~~~
# Define the Router object to use for this application.
# This router will be looked up first when the application is starting up,
# so make sure this is the entry point.
# Furthermore, it's assumed your route file is named properly.
# So for an application router like `my.application.Router`,
# you may need to define a router file `conf/my.application.routes`.
# Default to Routes in the root package (and conf/routes)
# play.http.router = my.application.Routes

# Database configuration
# ~~~~~
# You can declare as many datasources as you want.
# By convention, the default datasource is named `default`
#

# Set a connection's default autocommit setting
db.default.autocommit=true

# Set a connection's default isolation level
db.default.isolation=READ_COMMITTED

# In order to reduce lock contention and thus improve performance,
# each incoming connection request picks off a connection from a
# pool that has thread-affinity.
# The higher this number, the better your performance will be for the
# case when you have plenty of short-lived threads.
# Beyond a certain threshold, maintenance of these pools will start
# to have a negative effect on performance (and only for the case
# when connections on a partition start running out).
db.default.partitionCount=2

# The number of connections to create per partition. Setting this to
# 5 with 3 partitions means you will have 15 unique connections to the
# database. Note that BoneCP will not create all these connections in
# one go but rather start off with minConnectionsPerPartition and
# gradually increase connections as required.
db.default.maxConnectionsPerPartition=5

# The number of initial connections, per partition.
db.default.minConnectionsPerPartition=5

# When the available connections are about to run out, BoneCP will
# dynamically create new ones in batches. This property controls
# how many new connections to create in one go (up to a maximum of
# maxConnectionsPerPartition). Note: This is a per-partition setting.
db.default.acquireIncrement=1

# After attempting to acquire a connection and failing, try to
# connect this number of times before giving up.
db.default.acquireRetryAttempts=10

# How long to wait before attempting to obtain a
# connection again after a failure.
db.default.acquireRetryDelay=5 seconds

# The maximum time to wait before a call
# to getConnection is timed out.
db.default.connectionTimeout=1 second

# Idle max age
db.default.idleMaxAge=10 minute

# This sets the time for a connection to remain idle before sending a test query to the DB.
# This is useful to prevent a DB from timing out connections on its end.
db.default.idleConnectionTestPeriod=5 minutes

# An initial SQL statement that is run only when
# a connection is first created.
db.default.initSQL="SELECT 1"

# If enabled, log SQL statements being executed.

# The maximum connection age.
